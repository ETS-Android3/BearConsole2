<h1>Flash firmware help</h1>
<p>First you need to select the firmware</p>
<p>Then decide if you want to directly flash your firmware or use a recovery firmware first</p>
<p>Use a recovery firmware if the config is wrong and the altimeter can no longer connect.</p>
<p>After using a recover firmware you will need to flash the firmware.</p>
<p>Note that flashing the wrong firmware will result in an altimeter not working at all or not working as expected</p>
